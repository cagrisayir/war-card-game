# War Card Game 

This is my first Swift app. 

When game started: 
![app1](https://github.com/cagrisayir/war-card-game/assets/44059539/811a4f4d-8a34-43dc-8104-be5cc9c6a33e)

After a few play: 
![app2](https://github.com/cagrisayir/war-card-game/assets/44059539/ce2fc3d5-a863-4ab4-9f8c-b1d7d171f89e)


if user push the logo counts will be 0.
